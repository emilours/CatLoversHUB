# CAT LOVERS HUB üò∫

**Cat Lovers Hub** üò∫ is a fun project primarily created for learning and practicing with **Tailwind CSS** and **Flask**. The application leverages the **CAT API** to display various cat images and information, and a **JOKE API** to provide cat-themed jokes for some added fun. This project allows me to enhance my web development skills while building something for fun.
And this is a tribute to the best cat in the universe : mine, **Salem**.

### **Tech Stack Used** ‚öôÔ∏è

- **Frontend**: Tailwind with DaisyUI components, HTML üíª  
- **Backend**: Flask, Python ‚öôÔ∏è

###  **Get cat's picture: no breed information but a programming joke instead** üÉè
With the CAT API and the JOKE API, you can get a random cat picture paired with a programming joke, instead of breed information, for a fun !
